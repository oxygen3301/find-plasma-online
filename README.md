Find Plasma Online is a mobile app designed to act as a tool that assists the community to help each other in the crysis that we are facing today due to COVID-19. Compatible donors can share their info and thus help out patients who are in dire need of blood plasma for recovering from the fatal disease.

Users can open the app and either become a hero(share their details for donating) or ask for a hero's help. The details are matched and compatible donors' and recipients' contacts are shared with each other.
